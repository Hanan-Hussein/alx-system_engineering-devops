# Postmortem: Frontend-Backend Break in Small Website

## Issue Summary
**Duration**: May 18, 2023, 2:30 PM - May 18, 2023, 4:00 PM (EST)  
**Impact**: The frontend of a small website experienced a complete breakage, rendering the website inaccessible and resulting in a degraded user experience. Approximately 90% of the users were affected during the outage.

## Timeline
- **Issue Detected**: May 18, 2023, 2:30 PM (EST)
- **Issue Detection**: A customer support representative received multiple complaints from users unable to access the website and promptly reported the issue to the development team.
- **Actions Taken**: The development team immediately started investigating the frontend and backend components to identify the root cause of the breakage.
- **Misleading Investigation**: Initial suspicions led the team to focus primarily on frontend code issues, investing significant time and effort in debugging frontend components.
- **Escalation**: As the investigation yielded no significant progress, the incident was escalated to the backend development team to explore backend-related causes.
- **Incident Resolution**: After collaborative analysis between the frontend and backend teams, the root cause was identified and the issue was resolved.

## Root Cause and Resolution
**Root Cause**: The root cause of the frontend breakage was determined to be a backend service failure that disrupted the data flow between the frontend and backend. As a result, the frontend was unable to retrieve and display the necessary information.

**Resolution**: The backend service was restarted, which restored the data flow and re-established communication between the frontend and backend. Additionally, measures were taken to implement better monitoring and resilience in the backend service to prevent similar failures in the future.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures
1. Enhanced Monitoring: Implement comprehensive monitoring systems to detect and alert for potential backend service failures or disruptions.
2. Automated Recovery: Develop automated recovery mechanisms to proactively address backend service failures and restore communication with the frontend.
3. Load Testing: Conduct regular load testing to ensure the backend service can handle peak traffic and usage, reducing the risk of service disruptions.
4. Incident Response Plan: Establish a well-defined incident response plan that includes clear escalation paths and cross-team collaboration to streamline issue resolution.
5. Documentation Updates: Update documentation to provide clear instructions and troubleshooting guidelines for frontend-backend communication issues.
6. Continuous Integration and Testing: Integrate frontend and backend codebases to perform regular compatibility tests, verifying that changes in one component do not negatively impact the other.

## Conclusion
The frontend breakage in the small website was caused by a backend service failure, resulting in a disrupted data flow between the frontend and backend. By restarting the backend service, the issue was resolved, and communication between the frontend and backend was restored. To prevent similar incidents in the future, measures such as enhanced monitoring, automated recovery mechanisms, load testing, and improved documentation have been identified. Furthermore, integrating frontend and backend codebases and fostering cross-team collaboration will enhance compatibility and reduce the likelihood of frontend-backend breaks. These steps aim to improve the stability and reliability of the small website's frontend-backend communication.
